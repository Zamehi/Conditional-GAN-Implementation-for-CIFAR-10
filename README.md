# Conditional-GAN-Implementation-for-CIFAR-10

Your task is to implement a Conditional GAN (cGAN) model using the Person Face Sketches dataset. The goal of this task is to use sketches as input conditions to generate realistic face images. The model should learn how to map a given sketch to a corresponding real face during training. The model should be able to take any input sketch (provided by the user) and generate a realistic face image based on that sketch. Implementation Guidelines:
- You are required to refer to the original Conditional GAN paper for understanding the architecture and detailed implementation steps.
- Focus on ensuring that your model can condition on the sketch input to generate accurate and visually realistic face outputs. Data Set Person Face Sketches
